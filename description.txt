This mod allows you to see the stats of your yoyos, so you can choose between different modded yoyos without having to do a lot of testing or research to find their stats.
It does not show the total range including yoyo strings, and only shows the absolute *base* stats of the yoyo.
You can customize what stats show up, if you don't care about certain ones.
