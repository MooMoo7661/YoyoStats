This mod allows you to see the stats of your yoyos, so you can choose between different modded yoyos without having to do a lot of testing or research to find their stats.
It does not show the total range including yoyo strings, and only shows the absolute *base* stats of the yoyo.
You can customize what stats show up, if you don't care about certain ones.

DISCLAIMER! - Some stats might not show correctly for yoyos from other mods.
This is due to them setting speed changes in the AI, which this mod only detects the original set speed.
